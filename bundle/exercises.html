          <em>So why RxJs?</em>
          You can obviously handle most async work, events, & other callback operations with pure Javascript or framework that you are using. So why use RxJs? Well what if I told you that there was a functional programming library that allows you to manipulate the above operations at even given time. Would you see the value?<br>
          RxJs power lies in the out of the box operators/helpers that it has to increase the power of handling async events. <br>
          <blockquote><em>"Think of RxJs as Lodash for events</em></blockquote>
          <br>
          I couldn't sum it up any better than the RxJs team. So lets get into some small exercises to help us understand the library a bit more. The concepts are a bit different but once you catch on you will understand the power of this library.

      <h2>Intro Button Exercise</h2>
      <p>
        RxJs handles a click event much differently. As we all know pure functions mean that you're less likely to get errors & mess up state.

      <div class="rxjs-buttons">
        <button id="jsButton">Click Me!! (js)</button>
        <button id="rxjsButton">Click Me!! (rxjs)</button>

        <h2>Live Scores Exercise</h2>
        <p>
          Looks the same right? Nothing special... but check the code. Seems like overkill just to insert text into a dive right? Well lets complicate things a bit.
          <br>
          Suppose we are building out a small app that allows you to see live basketball score updates. You see the full score of the game & time remaining update every 5 seconds along w/ who scored the basket. The user has an option to replay the last x amount of scores. Lets compare how this is done in just JS versus RxJs. Here is what we care about...
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The score should update every 5 seconds as well as the time remaining in the quarter.</li>
          <li>
            We must keep track of all scores. 
            Show the most recent score but give the user an option to see past buckets.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <strong>
          The app isn't the point the exercise is so I will only show live score for 1 quarter not the whole game.
        </strong>
